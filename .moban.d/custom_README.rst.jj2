{%block description%}
**{{name}}** is a tiny wrapper library to read, manipulate and write data in xlsx and xlsm format using  `read_only` mode reader, `write_only` mode writer from openpyxl. You are likely to use it with `pyexcel <https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel>`__.

Please note:

1. `auto_detect_int` flag will not take effect because openpyxl detect integer in python 3 by default.
2. `skip_hidden_row_and_column` will get a penalty where `read_only` mode cannot be used.
